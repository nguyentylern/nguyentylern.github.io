This is a website made as a project for my GT Block class during my freshman year at Innovation Academy. GT Block is a two-period course that acclimates us students with the three pathways (Healthcare, IT, and Engineering) that Innovation Academy offers for students to follow.

The purpose of the website was to create a central source of information regarding online data privacy and how one can keep their information secure. The website and its information is not comprehensively developed, but serves as a presentation of our idea.

Thank you to Yuri Ante and Nico Borjas for their collaboration on this project.
