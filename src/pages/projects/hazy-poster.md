During the 2023 to 2024 school year, my friends Kashvi (kazyy) and Jae Ren (renji9) began creating music. Kashvi was the vocalist while Jae Ren was the producer. They released one single which featured cover art created by Hannah Lu. For their next release, they planned on creating an EP. Its cover art was created by Kashvi, and I created a promotional poster for its release.

In addition, I recorded guitar for the song "one, together" (where I was also the primary lyricist). Hannah Lu and I also contributed to lyrics on the EP elsewhere.
