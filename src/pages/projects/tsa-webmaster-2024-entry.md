During the 2023 to 2024 school year, Hannah Lu, Akshaj Dewan (AJ), and I entered the Technology Student Association's Webmaster Competition. Our project initially began with Hannah and I working on our own project and AJ working on his.

After the intraschool competition, AJ was nominated to go to the state competition, and he recruited Hannah and I to work on the submission. AJ and Hannah crafted the content of the website, while I focused on redesigning and recoding it. We placed eighth at the Georgia TSA State Leadership Conference.
